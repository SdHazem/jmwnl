# JMWNL #
JMWNL is a Java library and API, realized by the ART Research Group  at the University of Rome, Tor Vergata, for accessing lexical databases (in different languages) modeled after the Princeton WordNet dictionary model.

At present time, JMWNL supports the original Princeton WordNet and EuroWordNet dictionary formats.

JMWNL has been realized as an extension of the original <a href='http://jwordnet.sourceforge.net/'>Java WordNet Library</a> (version 1.4, rc2).

This is the project site of JMWNL, containing source code, bug reports etc... If you have stumbled upon this site for the first time, we recommend first to visit <a href='http://art.uniroma2.it/jmwnl/'>JMWNL home page</a>, which contains useful information such as installation requirements, documentation etc...
